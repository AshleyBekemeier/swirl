# Development

## ‚öôÔ∏è Set up the dev environment

`Node.js v16+`, `Git` and `Yarn v1` must be installed on your machine.

1. **Clone this repository**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:flip-corp/swirl.git
```

The Swirl Web Components Library is located at `packages/swirl-components`.

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
yarn
```

3. **Get Stencil.js and Storybook up and running**

```bash
cd packages/swirl-components
yarn start
```

Storybook will open in your default browser. Visit [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) if it doesn't.

## üÜï Create a new component

Run the following command to create boilerplate code for a new component. The component name has to start with "flip-" and must be in kebab-case.

```bash
yarn generate
```

The command will automatically create a new directory under `src/components` including all necessary files for your component. Here is an overview:

| File                | Contents                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| flip-\*.tsx         | The Stencil class component               |
| flip-\*.css         | The component stylesheet                  |
| flip-\*.mdx         | Markdown documentation for your component |
| flip-\*.spec.tsx    | Unit tests for your component             |
| flip-\*.stories.tsx | Storybook stories for your component      |

Storybook should show your new component immediately after generation.
