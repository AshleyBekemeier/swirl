# ðŸ–‹ Update Icons

The library automatically creates a separate Web Component for each icon. The
icons are generated from the corresponding SVG files, which can be found at
`src/assets/icons`.

**The icon components should therefore not be edited manually.** Instead, the
`yarn generate` command can be used to update the icon components. In addition
to generating the code, the generator also takes care of optimizing the SVGs.

To create a new icon, the SVG file can be copied to the `src/assets/icons`
directory. Then execute `yarn generate`.

```bash
cd packages/swirl-components
yarn generate  # then choose the "icons" option
```
