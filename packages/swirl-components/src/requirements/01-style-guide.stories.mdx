# ðŸ’… Style Guide

This is a style guide for the purpose of standardizing our Web Component development. This should be used as reference whenever you create a new component or update an existing one.

## File structure

All components live in the `src/components`directory and consist of various files, which are described in more detail in [the guide to creating new components](?path=/docs/guides-create-a-component--page).

New components are created using `yarn generate`, which ensures the correct directory structure. Please do not deviate from the generated structure.

## Naming components

Naming of the components is done according to the rules for Web Components. They must be written in "kebab-case" and contain at least one hyphen. To avoid name collisions, we also prefix our components with `flip-`.

- âœ… Valid names: `flip-button` or `flip-menu-item`.
- ðŸš« Invalid names: `button`, `menu-item`, `menuItem` or `MenuItem`.

Component names should be as short and concise as possible, and are always nouns, never verbs.

Dependencies between components should be reflected in the name. For example, a component for a list item which can only be used as a child of the list component `flip-list` should start with the name of the parent component. In this case `flip-list-item` would be appropriate.

## Code styles & formatting

Most code style rules are enforced by linting rules. Your IDE should be configured to show ESLint errors when editing code.

Code formatting is handled by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Any code that is committed must first be formatted with Prettier. It is recommended to configure your IDE so that formatting takes place on every save.

## Code organization

The component code should be structured so that component properties of the same type are defined in the same code block. For example, first all @Prop definitions, then all @Event definitions, then all lifecycle events, etc.

The `render` function should be the last block in the component code.

Types, interfaces, enums and helper functions needed for the component are defined above the class component.

Here is an example:

```typescript
import { Component, h, Prop } from "@stencil/core";

export type FlipButtonType = "button" | "submit";

@Component({
  tag: "flip-button",
  shadow: true,
  styleUrl: "flip-button.css",
})
export class FlipButton {
  @Prop() disabled?: boolean;
  @Prop() label!: string;
  @Prop() type?: FlipButtonType = "button";

  componentDidLoad() {
    console.log("Yay!");
  }

  componentDidRender() {
    console.log("Great!");
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button
        aria-disabled={this.disabled ? "true" : undefined}
        class="button"
        disabled={this.disabled}
        type={this.type}
      >
        {this.label}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```
