# ðŸ¤– Testing

With the help of tests we make sure that all components do what they are supposed to do and changes to the code do not lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Furthermore, we write regression tests to prevent bugs that have been fixed from occurring again.

All components are tested using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) unit tests. We deliberately do not define minimum requirements for code coverage, but test at least the functionality of the external component API (attributes, props and events), as well as the generated markup. Snapshot tests are permitted here.

**The error-free passing of all tests is a basic requirement for the merging of code changes, and the release of a new library version.**
