# Swirl Components

## Install and use components

The Swirl Web Components Library is made up of multiple components which you can import separately. All you need to do is install the @getflip/swirl-components package:

```bash
yarn add @getflip/swirl-components
# or
npm install --save @getflip/swirl-components
```

Then you can import and use the components:

```js
import { defineCustomElements } from "@getflip/swirl-components/loader";

defineCustomElements();
```
